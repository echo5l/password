# password

This is a simple program arised from a personal need to find annoying, duplicate characters in passwords generated by my password manager, Bitwarden. From there, I decided to create my own password generator using Java SecureRandom class.

### Requirements
A Java compiler is suffice

### Does it do anything?
Not much for now..
