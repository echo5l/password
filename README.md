# Password

This is a simple program arised from a personal need to find annoying, duplicate characters in passwords generated by my password manager, Bitwarden. From there, I decided to create my own password generator using Java SecureRandom class.

#### Requirements
A Java compiler is suffice

#### Does it do anything?
Not much for now..


```

        __Menu Options__:
    1.) Check Duplicate Character
    2.) Password Generator
    3.) Unique Password Generator
    4.) Exit

```

#### TODO
Adding a more features along with my renewed interest in cryptography.
Learn how to create a docker image for this project.
