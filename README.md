# Password

This simple program arised from a personal need to find annoying, duplicate characters in passwords generated by my password manager, Bitwarden. From there, I decided to create my own password generator using Java SecureRandom class.


#### Requirements
A Java compiler is suffice


#### Does it do anything?
Not much for now..


```
        __Menu Options__:
    1.) Check Duplicate Character
    2.) Password Generator
    3.) Unique Password Generator
    4.) Exit
```


#### Tasks
- [ ] Modify option 1 to replace duplicate with unique characters. Assuming most passwords are less than 94 char long.
- [ ] Add SHA encrypt
- [ ] Add SHA decrypt
- [ ] Add AES encrypt
- [ ] Add AES decrypt
- [ ] Test password strength

##### TODO
* Add few more features along with my renewed interest in cryptography.
* Learn how to create a docker image for this project.
